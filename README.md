# Iron Bank

[![Build Status][travis-status]][travis-build]

An opinionated Ruby interface to the [Zuora REST API][zuora-dev].

> We who serve the Iron Bank face death full as often as you who serve the Iron
> Throne.

_(A Dance with Dragons, Chapter 44, Jon IX)_

This gem provides opinionated resources to interact with the Zuora API through
their REST interface. It defines **associations** between them, as well as a
simple **declaration API** (`with_one`, `with_many`) to extend them.

This gem is tested against Ruby `>= 2.4`.

Please use [GitHub Issues][issues] to report bugs.

## Getting Started

You will need:

- a **Zuora tenant** (apisandbox, services, performances or production)
- an **administrator access** to this tenant (to gain API access)
- and an **OAuth client** for this user
  ([Zuora documentation][zuora-doc-oauth])

IronBank is a pure Ruby client, but we do provide a generator (for the
configuration) when using it within [Rails][rails-website].

Add the gem to your `Gemfile` with:

```rb
gem 'iron_bank'
```

And run the `bundle` command to install it. You then need to run the generator:

```
$ rails generate iron_bank:install
```

Use the `client_id` and `client_secret` from your Zuora OAuth client and add
them to the generated `config/initializers/iron_bank.rb` file.

## Configuration

```rb
# Configure Ironbank
IronBank.configure do |config|
  config.client_id         = 'client_id'
  config.client_secret     = 'client_secret'
  config.auth_type         = 'auth_type'
  config.domain            = 'zuora-domain'   # zuora doamin
  config.export_directory  = 'directory-path' # export directory path
  config.schema_directory  = 'directory-path' # schema drirectory path

  # Ironbank uses Faraday to send request to Zuora. Middlewares can be specified
  # by adding the class name and class options to the `middlewares` 
  # configuration.
  # Faraday middlewares, we can send in an array with cutomer middleware class
  # and options
  config.middlewares << [DummyMiddlewareClass, {}]
end

```

## Usage

```rb
# make a query to Zuora using ZOQL
IronBank::Query.call "select Name from Account where Id='zuora-account-id'"

# retrieve an account
account = IronBank::Account.find 'zuora-account-id'
# => #<IronBank::Resources::Account>

# access this resource attributes
account.name # => 'My Company Inc.'

# or associated objects
account.bill_to
# => #<IronBank::Resources::Contact>

account.active_subscriptions
# => [#<IronBank::Resources::Subscription>]
```

## Local records

If your product catalog does not change often, you may want to export
it locally so that product catalog and related object queries look for
**local records** first, then **fallback** to the API if no records are found.

You can export your product catalog locally using the `LocalRecords` class:

```rb
# Save CSV files in the directory specified by `config.export_directory`
IronBank::LocalRecords.export
```

Then, making a query/looking for a record will first search through the local
records, then default to the API if no records are found.

```rb
product = IronBank::Product.find 'zuora-product-id'
# => #<IronBank::Resources::Product>

product.plans[0].charges[0].tiers[0]
# => #<IronBank::Resources::ProductRatePlanChargeTier>
```

Without local records, the previous scenario will make **4 requests** to Zuora
to access the charge tiers. By exporting local records, you can significantly
reduce your execution time, e.g., when building a `SubscriptionRequest`.

## Development

1. After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies
2. Edit the copied `.env` file with your Zuora credentials
3. Execute `bundle exec rake` to run the linters and tests
4. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you
   to experiment with the Zuora APIs

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at
https://github.com/zendesk/iron_bank.

## Known issues

- `AutoPay` field on the `Invoice` object is not queryable using ZOQL despite
  the metadata showing `<selectable>true</selectable>`, hence it has been added
  to the `exclude_fields` method.
